A very simple C++ Console Program written in Microsoft Visual Studios 2019.

The idea behind this short program was to ease the creation of new functions
whenever I want to add a new C++ function to a program.

This program takes in type of the function the name of 1 header file, and 
the desired name of the function and then prints out the the screen a 
prototype declaration, function definition and function call.

This program currently runs continously to allow multiple functions 
to be created in a session.
