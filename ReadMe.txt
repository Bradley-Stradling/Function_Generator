A very simple C++ Console Program written in Microsoft Visual Studios 2019.

The idea behind this short program was to ease the creation of new functions
whenever I want to add a new C++ function to a program.

This program takes in type of the function the name of 1 header file, and 
the desired name of the function and then prints out the screen an 
include statment, prototype declaration, function definition and 
function call template.

This program currently runs continously to allow multiple functions 
to be created in a session. But could be easily modified to write to a 
text file and exit upon completion.

Another option or expansion upon this concept could be storing
multiple header or needed include files at program start, then
writing them to a text file and then creating multiple function
templates.
